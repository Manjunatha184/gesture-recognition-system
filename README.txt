Gesture Recognition System:

This project implements a gesture recognition system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and a Random Forest classifier. The system captures hand gestures from a live video feed, processes the images to extract hand landmarks, and classifies the gestures into predefined categories. The model can recognize up to 20 different gestures and can be customized for different applications.

The project is divided into four main parts: data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and real-time gesture recognition. First, images of different hand gestures are collected using a webcam. These images are then processed to extract hand landmarks using MediaPipe. A Random Forest classifier is trained on this data, and the trained model is used to recognize gestures in real-time from a webcam feed.

The model can recognize up to 20 different gestures, making it suitable for various applications such as sign language interpretation, human-computer interaction, and more.

The project is divided into four main parts: data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and real-time gesture recognition. Initially, images of different hand gestures are collected using a webcam. These images are then processed to extract hand landmarks using MediaPipe, which provides a robust method for hand tracking.
